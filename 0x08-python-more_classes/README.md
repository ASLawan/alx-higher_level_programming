# 0x08. Python - 
## More Classes and Objects
This project was based on python classes and objects  
## Task 0: Simple rectangle  
This task invloved creating an empty class Rectangle  
## Task 1: Real definition of a rectamgle  
This task involved initializing width and height attributes  
Defining getter and setter methods to handle the attributes  
## Task 2: Area and Perimeter  
Two public instance methods implemented in the class to compute area and perimeter of object  
## Task 3: String representation  
Here I implemented the __str__ function to print out object in user friendly format  
## Task 4: Eval is magic  
This is similar to task 3 but here output is printed in developer friendly format using __repr__
## Detect instance deletion
In this task I implemented a method to handle deletion of objects using __del__
## How many instances  
This task handles and keeps track of number of instances created and deleted with a public class attribute
## Change representation
Here, the class is capable of printing object output with dfferent simples using print_symbol attribute
## Compare rectangles
In this task, the implemented method compares areas of two rectangles and returns the biggest one.  
Method returns first rectangle if both are equal  
## A square is a rectangle  
Using a class method, a new Rectangle instance is created in which height and width and both equal in length
