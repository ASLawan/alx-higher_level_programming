# 0x0C. Python Almost a Circle# 0x0C. Python Almost a Circle  
This project was an opportunity to review and revise all the  
concepts we have learnt so far in python with focus on:
- Classes
- Inheritance
The project is broken into the following tasks
## Tasks
### Task 1 - Base Class
Here I created a package in which i defined and an empty class  
Base

### Task 2 - First Rectangle
This task defines another class, Rectangle that inherits from Base,   
the class defined in task 1. This class has four attributes, all   
private

### Task 3 - Validate Attributes
In this task, class Rectangle is updated by adding getter and  
setter methods. Input validation was also handled for all  
attributes

### Task 4 - First Area
In task four, I updated class Rectangle with a public method that  
computes aread of each rectangle object

### Task 5 - Display #0
Here, class Rectangle is updated by adding a public method that  
prints to stdout the Rectangle instance with the character #

### Task 6 - __str__
In this task, the class is again updated with a method tha prints  
formatted out.

### Task 7 - Display #1
In the previouse display function we made use of just two attributes  
length and width. Here we handle x and y attributes by printing 
corresponding empty spaces as values of x and y

### Task 8 - Update #0
A public method implemented to receive a variable number of non-keyword   
arguments and assigne them to each attribute.

### Task 9 - Update #1
This update method is an update to the previouse one. Here we are handling   
keyword arguments. If the arguments supplied are non-keyword or keyword  
arguments, this function handles it and assignes them to respective  
attributes

### Task 10 - And now, the Square
Here, a new class is defined, class Square. This class inherits from the  
class Rectangle and has size attribute.

### Task 11 - Square Size
In this task, we update the Square class defined. Getter and setter methods  
were added to retreive and set the values of the attribute size. This   
attribute uses same validation as width and length attributes defined in   
class Rectangle

### Task - 12 - Square update
Here, an upate method just like in the Rectangle class. This public method  
handles varaible number of non-keyword and keyword arguments and assignes  
values to attributes.

### Task 13 - Rectangle instance to dictionary representation
Here, we implemented a function that returns the dictionary representation   
of a Rectangle instance, using attribute names as keys.  

### Task 14 - Square instance to dictionary representation
Here, we implemented a function that returns the dictionary representation   
of a Square instance, using attribute names as keys.

### Task 15 - Dictionary to JSON string
This task implemented a static method that returns the JSON string from a  
dictionary representation of each instance

### Task 16 - JSON string to file
This task involved implementing a class method that writes JSON string  
representation of object instances to a file. This was implemented as an   
update to the class Base.

### Task 17 - JSON string to dictionary
The class Base is updated with a static method that returns the list of JSON  
string representation.

### Task 18 - Dictionary to instance
Class Base is updated with a class method that returns an instance with all  
attributes already set.

### Task 19 - File to instances
Class Base is updated by adding a class method that returns list of instances
